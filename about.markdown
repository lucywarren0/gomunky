This is where I'll brief the purpose of my website and the types of content I'll be posting. 'Projects' will hold academic works, art portfolios, and personal working ideas ie. poems, designs, schemes, etc. 'Photography' will hold a gallery of photos I've taken as well as some of my favorie art pieces. Weet, woot, enjoy!
