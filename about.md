This is where I'll have a little blurb about myself. Name and general details, what I like and do. I am this and that, rah rah rah, weet woot.

I'm using a Jekyll theme called Munky, aimed for portfolio websites. It features a blog, project,
photography and about page. The theme is customizable through the `_config.yml`
settings and by changing the sass variables in `_sass\munky.scss`.
